TLDR Comic Books
==================
Founded By Ishan Dasgupta and Aaditya Ganesan
The Mission
----------
We founded TLDR to share our passion for comic books with other
people. We recognized the barrier to entry to reading comic books
was high, at times very confusing, and esoteric. TLDR is a
mechanism for comic book readers to fully understand comics
quickly. If you have any recommended comics we should add or want
to add a TLDR yourself, join the Discord. If you want to follow
along with our journey, follow our instagram! Thank you!
